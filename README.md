# JupyterLite Template
## How-to
This template helps you to deploy JupyterLite on GitHub Pages.  

The process is automated using GitHub Actions. Simply click on **Use this template** to generate a repository.  

If the deployment failed, go to **Settings > Actions > General**. In the **Workflow permission** section, ensure that **Read an write permissions** is checked.  
Also, check in **Pages** that the Source **GitHub Actions** is selected.  

## Accessing your JupyterLite website
After the build has completed, the site will be available on GitHub Pages. The link of your JupyterLite website will be `https://YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io/YOUR-REPO-NAME`  
The link will be displayed in the Repository **Settings** > **Pages** and as an output in your GitHub Actions workflow
